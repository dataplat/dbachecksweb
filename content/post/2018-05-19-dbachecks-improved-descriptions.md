With the latest release of [dbachecks](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/dbachecks/1.1.128) we have added a new check for testing that foreign keys and constraints are trusted thanks to ClÃ¡udio Silva [b](https://claudioessilva.eu/) | [t](https://twitter.com/ClaudioESSilva)

To get the latest release you will need to run

    Update-Module dbachecks

You should do this regularly as we release [new improvements frequently](/version-update-code-signing-and-publishing-to-the-powershell-gallery-with-vsts/).

We have also added better descriptions for the checks which was suggested by the same person who inspired the previous improvement [I blogged about here](/dbachecks-which-configuration-item-for-which-check/)

Instead of the description just being the name of the check it is now more of a, well, a description really ðŸ™‚

This has the added effect that it means that just running Get-DbcCheck in the command line will not fit all of the information on a normal screen

You can use the [Format-Table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/format-table?view=powershell-5.1) command (or its alias ft at the command line) and select the properties to display using

    Get-DbcCheck | ft -Property UniqueTag, Description -Wrap

or you can use [Format-ListÂ ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/format-list?view=powershell-5.1)(or its alias fl at the command line)

    Get-DbcCheck | fl

Or you can use [Out-GridView](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/out-gridview?view=powershell-5.1)Â (or its alias ogv at the command line) (Incidentally, could you also thumbs up [this issue on Github](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3957) to get Out-GridView functionality in PowerShell 6)

    Get-DbcCheck | ogv
